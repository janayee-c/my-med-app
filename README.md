My Med App ! 💊
Project Overview
The design goal of this project entails implementing a working application that enables users to efficiently track personal prescription data over time with the aim of improving medicine adherence. Overall, the interface aims to aid a user demographic of patients that regularly take medication or utilize routine medical practices (eg. diabetes therapy/injection) with independent administration of medication and monitoring; data abstraction includes representing general information including dosage, precautions and potential side effects of prescriptions, as well as personal tools that the user can utilize to track the quantity of their prescription over time and symptoms that can be recorded for future reference. Holistically, the program will be able to represent the patient user's personal information inclusive of diagnoses, preferred pharmacy/healthcare provider, overall list of prescriptions, prescription history and schedule of medications to be administered in the next 24-hour period. Within the list of prescriptions, each individual instance of medicine/prescription will include attributes such as treatment overview (purpose and usage), quantity of prescription, future refill dates, historical refill dates and the ability to customize input of the amount of treatments left. Potential methods will allow the patient to indicate whether they missed a dose or administered multiple amounts within the scheduled timeframe, enabling respective incrementation up or down of medicine quantity. The list of prescriptions will also include methods allowing a patient to update the list, while the scheduling class will include capacities to schedule pills according to specified dosage times (eg. every twelve hours, every 24 hours), accept input from the user regarding time dosage was taken, inform the patient of the last time a pill was administered and reset a prescription schedule depending on circumstances when dosages are not followed.

Personal Input
The idea for this project was originated from my personal difficulties with remembering to take my prescribed medication on a daily schedule. Often, I struggle with recalling whether I took a pill at a certain time, and quantifying the amount of pills I have left to take and when to request my next refill. This application aims to aid similar individuals who have trouble with self-monitoring prescription medication through conveniently providing information on schedule, inventory and dosage instructions.
